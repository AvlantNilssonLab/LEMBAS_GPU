Scripts from the original GPU implementation written by Avlant that were adapted in this repository. Scripts that end in "_mod" were further modified by me to ensure things ran/worked in agreement with my version of the code, particularly for direct comparisons of reproducibility (see commit ID 8f591b3ef1b210ae507ec25a9f70532396caba1a "final fully reproducible lembas" run). 

Notebooks show comparison of outputs from that commit checkpoint between my implementation of the code (_HB) and the modified version of Avlant's code (_AN). The newest version of the code and it's implementation can be viewed in ../docs/macrophage_example.ipynb.
